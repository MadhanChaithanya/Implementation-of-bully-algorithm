## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BULLY ALGORITHM:

### The objective of the project is to implement the bully algorithm. In distributed computing, the bully algorithm is a method for dynamically electing a coordinator or leader from a group of distributed computer processes. 
### The process with the highest process ID number from amongst the non-failed processes is selected as the coordinator.
* ### METHODS:-
